My official repo for Hacktober Fest 2k23 contributions. 🚀🧑‍🚀🧑‍💻
Fork and clone the main repo.

Create a folder with your name and add contributor.txt in the sub folder along with the project folder that you developed.
The final tree structure of the folders must be like:
<Folder_with_Name>
-----Project Folder
-----Contributor.txt

Further then open a PR with your new project pushed in this structure discussed above.

The contributor.txt must be compliant with the Contribution guidelines mentioned in the Contribution.md file on the main repo.
Try to document the work done ✅
