Fork and clone the main repo.

Create a folder with your name and add contributor.txt in the sub folder along with the project folder that you developed.
The final tree structure of the folders must be like:
<Folder_with_Name>
-----Project Folder
-----Contributor.txt

Further then open a PR with your new project pushed in this structure discussed above.

The contributor.txt must be compliant with the Contribution guidelines mentioned in the readme file on the main repo.
